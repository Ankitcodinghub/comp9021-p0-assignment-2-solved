1. General Matters

1.1 Aim

The purpose of this assignment is to:

â€¢ Develop your problem-solving skills.

â€¢ Design and implement the solution to a problem in the form of a medium sized Python program.

â€¢ Analyse the various features of a labyrinth, represented by a particular coding of its basic elements

into numbers, from the set Assignment Project Exam Help{0, 1, 2, 3} only, stored in a text file.

â€¢ Check that the input text file is correct and represents a labyrinth.

â€¢ Use object-oriented programming.

1.2 Marking

Your program will be tested against several inputs. For each test, the auto-marking script will let your program run for 30 seconds. The outputs of your program should be exactly as indicated.

Please make sure not to change the filename labyrinth.py while submitting by clicking on [Mark] button in Ed. It is your responsibility to check that your submission did go through properly using Submissions link in Ed otherwise your mark will be zero for Assignment 2.

2. Description

The representation of the labyrinth is based on a coding with only the four digits 0, 1, 2 and 3 such that:

â€¢ 0 codes points that are connected to neither their right nor their below neighbours:

â€¢ 1 codes points that are connected to their right neighbours but not to their below ones:

â€¢ 2 codes points that are connected to their below neighbours but not to their right ones:

â€¢ 3 codes points that are connected to both their right and below neighbours:

A point that is connected to none of their left, right, above, and below neighbours represents a pillar:

Analysing the labyrinth will also allow to represent:

â€¢ cul-de-sac:

â€¢ entry-exit path:

4. Detailed Description

4.1 Input

The input is expected to consist of ydim lines of xdim members of {0, 1, 2, 3}, where x dim and ydim are at least equal to 2 and at most equal to 31 and 41, respectively, with possibly lines consisting of spaces only that will be ignored and with possibly spaces anywhere on the lines with digits.

The xth digit n of the yth line, with 0 â‰¤ x &lt; xdim and 0 â‰¤ y &lt; ydim, is to be:

â€¢ associated with a point situated x * 0.5 cm to the right and y * 0.5 cm below an origin,

â€¢ connected to the point 0.5 cm to its right if n = 1 or n = 3, and

â€¢ connected to the point 0.5 cm below itself if n = 2 or n = 3.

The last digit on every line with digits (that is, not on blank lines) cannot be equal to 1 or 3, and the digits on the last line with digits cannot be equal to 2 or 3, which ensures that the input encodes a labyrinth, that is, a grid of width (xdim â€“ 1) * 0.5 cm and of height (ydim â€“ 1) * 0.5 cm (hence of maximum width 15 cm and of maximum height 20 cm), with possibly gaps on the sides and inside.

A point not connected to any of its neighbours is thought of as a Assignment Project Exam Helppillar and a point connected to at least one of its neighbours is thought of as part of a wall.

4.2 Output

Consider executing from the Python prompt the statement from labyrinth import * followed by the statement lab = Labyrinth(filename). In case filename does not exist in the working directory, then Python will raise a FileNotFoundError exception, that does not need to be caught. Assume that filename does exist (in the working directory). If the input is incorrect in that it does not contain only digits in {0, 1, 2, 3} besides spaces, or in that it contains either too few or too many nonblank lines, or in that some nonblank lines contain too many or too few digits, or in that two of its nonblank lines do not contain the same number of digits, then the effect of executing lab = Labyrinth(filename) should be to generate a LabyrinthError exception that reads:

If the previous conditions hold but the further conditions spelled out above for the input to qualify as a labyrinth (that is, the condition on the last digit on every line with digits and the condition on the digits on the last line) do not hold, then the effect of executing lab = Labyrinth(filename) should be to generate a LabyrinthError exception that reads:

If the input is correct and represents a labyrinth, then lab = Labyrinth(filename) followed by lab.display_features() should have the effect of outputting the following:

1. the number of gates, that is, the number of consecutive points on one of the four sides of the labyrinth that are not connected,

2. the number of sets of connected walls, 3. the number of inner points that cannot be accessed from any gate, starting from the point in the

middle of a gate and going from inner points to neighbouring inner points, Assignment Project Exam Help

4. the number of maximal areas that can be accessed from at least one gate (the number of accessible inner points is at most equal to the number of gates),

6. the number of entry-exit paths with no intersections not to cul-de-sacs consisting of a maximal set S of connected inner points that go from a gate to another (necessarily different) gate and such that for all points p in S, there is only one way to move on from p without getting back and without entering a cul-de-sac, in other words, the resulting path is choice-free, that is, such that leaving the path, at any inner point where that is possible, immediately leads into a cul-de-sac.

The above should be displayed exactly as described below.

A first line that reads one of:

The labyrinth has no gate.

The labyrinth has a single gate.

The labyrinth has N gates.

with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2.

A second line that reads one of:

The labyrinth has no wall.

The labyrinth has walls that are all connected.

The labyrinth has N sets of walls that are all connected.

with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2.

A third line that reads one of:

The labyrinth has no inaccessible inner point.

The labyrinth has a unique inaccessible inner point. The labyrinth has N inaccessible inner points.

with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2.

A fourth line that reads one of:

The labyrinth has no accessible area.

The labyrinth has a unique accessible area. Assignment Project Exam Help The labyrinth has N accessible areas.

A fifth line that reads one of:

The labyrinth has accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected.

The labyrinth has N sets of accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected.

with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2.

A sixth line that reads one of:

The labyrinth has no entry-exit path with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs.

The labyrinth has a unique entry-exit path with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs. The labyrinth has N entry-exit paths with no intersections not to cul-de-sacs.

with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2.
